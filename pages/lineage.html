            <h4>History</h4>
            <p>
              Sanbo Kyodan (Three Treasures Religious Organization) was founded
              in 1954 by Yasutani Hakuun Roshi who was dharma successor to
              Harada Sogaku Roshi. Yamada Koun Roshi (1970-1989) became the
              second abbot after Yasutani Roshi and he was in turn succeeded by
              Kubota Roshi (1989-2004) and Yamada Ryoun Roshi (2004 to date) as
              the third and fourth abbots accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2013, Sanbo Kyodan decided to formalize its international
              structure and at the same time change its name to Sanbo Zen. This
              was necessary as the Zen teachers and groups under its lineage had
              grown tremendously in many countries around the world and had
              outgrown its present organizational structure.
            </p>
            <p>
              It accepts practitioners from all religious backgrounds and has a
              long history of non Japanese disciples who, after completion of
              formal zen training and being sanctioned as authentic teachers,
              return to their home countries to teach Zen. This was the wish and
              plan of Koun Roshi. Unique amongst them are a number of Christian
              clergies.

            <h4>Current Day</h4>
            <p>
              Sanbo Zen is a lay group which practises authentic Zen with an
              emphasis on kensho (seeing oneâ€™s true nature) or enlightenment.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to Yamada Koun Roshi, as long as you are a human being,
              you have the qualifications to achieve enlightenment, whatever
              your religious belief.
